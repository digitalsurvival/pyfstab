# pystab

pystab is a MIT licensed python 3 library that is capable of parsing and editing the /etc/fstab file. It was created for [stager](https://github.com/gentoo/stager), Gentoo's installer.

For feature requests open a [new issue](https://github.com/digitalsurvival/pyfstab/issues/new) with the label "feature request."

For everything else can catch me on Freenode IRC under the handle maffblaster.
